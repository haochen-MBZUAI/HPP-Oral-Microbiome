## Data Access

### HPP (Human Phenotype Project)
- **Controlled Access**: Due to ethical and IRB requirements, HPP data is available through a controlled-access portal.
- **Access Portal**: <https://humanphenotypeproject.org/data-access>
- **Process**: Researchers must submit a statement of purpose and sign a data use agreement. Upon approval, data can be accessed in a secure environment.
- **Ethics Approval**: Weizmann Institute IRB **#1719-1**.
- **Data Scope**: This study utilizes oral swab metagenomes (MetaPhlAn 4 / HUMAnN 3.6 outputs) and 44 metabolic phenotypes, including liver ultrasound, CGM, and DXA.
- **We do not provide any controlled data in this repository**. You can run the code in this repository within the approved environment to reproduce the experiments.
